# About me.
I am an independent scholar. Currently, I am pursuing AI courses at the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore, where I am further expanding my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and project-based risk management. Some of my key term projects include:

* Text Mining: Sentiment analysis of r/WallStreetBets [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/aniruok9/CS5246-Text-Mining-project)
* AI Planning and Decision Making: Simulation of urban mobility in Singapore [Forked from Lucus Alegre GitHub Pages](https://github.com/anochasut/sumo-rl) and [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/achmadyogi/SumoProject)
* Big Data Analytics: Analyzing the impact of COVID-19 using Twitter data [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/sancsaha/CS5344)
* Natural Language Processing: Grammatical error detection on Wi+Lochness [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/azztt/CS4248_Project)
* Sound and Music Computation: Depression Dectection in Voice Clips [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/anochasut/DepressionDetection)

My continouous interest is at Chatbot for mental health support which is kindly supported by Prof. XXX for using resources in computation. Hopefully I could share some of my results here soon.
