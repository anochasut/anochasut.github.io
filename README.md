# About me.
I am an idependent scholar. Currently, I am pursuing AI courses at the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore, where I am further expanding my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and project-based risk management. Some of my key term projects include:

* Text Mining: Sentiment analysis of r/WallStreetBets [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* AI Planning and Decision Making: Simulation of urban mobility in Singapore [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Big Data Analytics: Analyzing the impact of COVID-19 using Twitter data [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Natural Language Processing: Grammatical error detection on Wi+Lochness [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Sound and Music Computation: Depression Dectection in Voice Clips [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

My continouous interest is at Chatbot for mental health support which is kindly supported by Prof. XXX for using resources in computation. Hopefully I could share some of my results here soon.
